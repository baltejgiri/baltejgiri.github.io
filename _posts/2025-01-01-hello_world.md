# Welcome to my blogpost!

Hi Everyone, I am starting a new blogpost in 2025. I will be writing blogs about my journey in Information Technology to be a Computer Network Expert. I am currently working as Network Analyst/Admin in the healthcare industry. Blogging is one of the way to reinforce what you have learn by reading and doing labs and, sometimes what you have learnt from troubleshooting a network issue.

Please stay tuned for my very first technical blogpost!
