>> In progress..

A out of box device comes with default configuration, a switch with it's default configuration is ready to forward frames within default VLAN 1. We have to configure switch the way we need it to function. In this post we will cover how to stage a network device.

## Purpose
We will be going to configure a layer 2 network device. The purpose of installing this new switch in production network is to expand the network capacity. Expanding network capacity usually has more steps involved like required the future growth, available ip addresses on each VLAN, installing new data drops and such. 

## What is network device staging?
The process of preparing and configuring network devices before they are deployed into a live network environment. Device staging ensure's that the devices are correctly set up, tested, and validated in a controlled environment to avoid possible issues when they are installed in production.
