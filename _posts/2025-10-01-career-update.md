## Where am i in my career?

![Career Update](/assets/img/image_1.jpg)

It's been close to a year since I have joined my current organization as network analyst for wired network responsible for monitoring, administrating and, troubleshooting tasks. This role has given me a great exposure to organizations technical and no technical side. I learnt how does the network team supports various teams to operate the health care systems. From technical prospective, I have learnt layer 2 in details that I have not looked at it before. I am glad I spend time into this role. Along the way I had some opportunities to create documentation for new devices like power data units that are used heavily in network closets to manage different king of power like normal power, vital power and so on.

I am glad to day I am now moving into Wireless Network role where I will be working with Cisco technologies to wireless survey's, design access point placement utilizing wireless survey's, administrating Wireless LAN Controllers and much more. This is an existed role as well a challenging role too. I am ready to take on a big step forward in my career where I will be focusing on a particular area of interest.

I would like to thanks my direct manager ***Mike Hines*** in the organization for supporting my decision and helping me to grow in my career. A special thanks to ![Dave A](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-a-14643a125/) who has been helping with learning the networking technologies.
