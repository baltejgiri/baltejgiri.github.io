## Where am i in my career?

![Career Update](/assets/img/image_1.jpg)

A year ago, I made a move from working with an Internet Service Provider to the healthcare industry. I worked as a Network Operator at an ISP. Simply put, I was a firefighter, but for networks—actually a different kind of firefighter. Many people don't think about us because IT professionals typically work behind the scenes—we're only noticed when something goes wrong. To most people, the network operates seamlessly, almost magically. I was part of a dedicated team that maintained that seamless experience 24/7, 365 days a year. Time at Network Operator team gave tremendous exposure to enterprise networks and technologies.

New role as network analyst at health authority helped me to use my skills for monitoring and troubleshooting but I could also learn new skill in network administration. I supported the organizations network with configuration and implementation for day-to-day requirements. Along the way, I learnt organization’s structure and how network is utilized in each department. I knew the networks team is growing and there would be future growth within the team. Soon enough my manager was looking for Wireless Network Administrator and I expressed my interest to move into the wireless team. While I was working at ISP, I did spend some good time working with DOCSIS technologies. DOCSIS modems uses the radio frequencies which are the fundamentals of wireless networks.

I am progressing

This role has played a vital role for me to grasp a good overall understanding of organization both from technical perspective; I have learnt layer 2 in details that I have not looked at it before. I am glad I spend time into this role. Along the way I had some opportunities to create documentation for new devices like power data units that are used heavily in network closets to manage different king of power like normal power, vital power and so on.
 
I am glad to day I am now moving into Wireless Network role where I will be working with Cisco technologies to wireless survey's, design access point placement utilizing wireless survey's, administrating Wireless LAN Controllers and much more. This is an existed role as well a challenging role too. I am ready to take on a big step forward in my career where I will be focusing on a particular area of interest.
 
I would like to thanks my direct manager ***Mike Hines*** in the organization for supporting my decision and helping me to grow in my career. A special thanks to [Dave A](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-a-14643a125/) who has been helping with learning the networking technologies.
