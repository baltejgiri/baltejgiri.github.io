### Password Security Checklist

- [x] Set console password
- [x] Set VTY (Telnet/SSH) password
- [x] Set enable (privileged EXEC) password
- [x] Encrypt all passwords
- [x] Set login banners (optional for legal notice)

### Step-by-Step Configuration

#### 1. Set Console Password
Following lines of commands configures a password for console line 0. The login command explicitly enables the password on switch.
````plaintext
Switch(config)# line console 0
Switch(config-line)# password YOUR_CONSOLE_PASSWORD
Switch(config-line)# login
Switch(config-line)# exit
````

#### 2. Set VTY (Telnet/SSH) Password
Similar to console password, line vty 0 to 15 are setup with a password. The login command explicitly enables the password on switch.
````plaintext
Switch(config)# line vty 0 15
Switch(config-line)# password YOUR_VTY_PASSWORD
Switch(config-line)# login
Switch(config-line)# exit
````

#### 3. Set Enable (Privileged EXEC) Password
Secure's the privilege exec mode, enable secret password is required when moving from user exac mode to privilege exac mode. 
````plaintext
Switch(config)# enable secret YOUR_ENABLE_PASSWORD
````

#### 4. Encrypt All Passwords
Service password-encryption command encrypts the plain text passwords to Type 7, type 7 was primarily intended to prevent casual viewing of passwords.
````plaintext
Switch(config)# service password-encryption
````

#### 5. Set Login Banners (Optional)

````plaintext
Switch(config)# banner motd # Unauthorized access is prohibited. #
````

### Verification

To verify the password security configuration, you can use the following commands:

- **Show running configuration**: To view the current configuration and ensure passwords are set.
- **Show version**: To check if the password encryption service is enabled.

```plaintext
Switch# show running-config
Switch# show version
```

### Conclusion

By following this checklist and configuration guide, you can enhance the password security of your Cisco switch and protect it from unauthorized access. Regularly review and update your password policies and configurations to maintain a secure network environment. Although setting up basic password security provides a method to secure switches however, if there are large number of user's access the switch there is a easier access management options using AAA security framework. AAA security framework ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources and their access can be permitted or denied based when needed. AAA often implemented using RADIUS or TACACS+ protocols.
