## LAB Configuration for inter-vlan routing using ROAS, SVI and Routed Ports

### Multi-layer Switch Configuration 
Mutlilayer Switch configuration with Switch Virtual Interface for VLAN 10 and 11.

- Switch's hostname is set to multilayer-sw1.
- Interfaces Gig1/2-3 and Gi0/2-3 are configured with access port on vlan 10 and vlan 11 respectively.
- All access port's are set with port security mode to restric and age timmer with 5 minute along with portfast.
- To prevent log messages to interpt from CLI enteries, logging synchronous is set.
- SVI's are created for VLAN 10 and 11 and assigned with ip address.
- Switch's interface Gig0/0 is set to routed port which connects to Router as a point to point link.
- Static Route is set to forward traffic destined for networks outside of Local Area Network.
- IP addresses and port status are verified at last.
- Connectivity between both VLANs is tested using ping command from a endpoint to another of each vlan.
- Configuration is saved on multilayer switch at last.

### Router Configuration
Router's Gi0/0 port is configured as a point-to-point link with Multi-layer switch and interface Gi0/1 and sub-interfaces Gi0/1.12 and Gi0/1.13 for router on stick.

    end
    !
    show ip int brief

    !
    copy running-config startup-config


### Layer 2 Switch configuration
Layer 2 switch is configutred with two vlan's 12 and 13, it's gig0/0 port will be a trunk port with vlans 12,13 allowed along with native vlan 1.


    enable
    configure terminal
    no banner exec
    no banner incoming
    no banner login
    !
    hostname layer-2-sw1
    !
    line con 0
    logging synchronous
    exit
    !
    interface gig0/3
    switchport access vlan 12
    switchport mode access
    switchport port-security violation restrict
    switchport port-security aging time 5
    spanning-tree portfast
    interface gig1/3
    switchport access vlan 13
    switchport mode access
    switchport port-security violation restrict
    switchport port-security aging time 5
    spanning-tree portfast
    interface gig0/0
    description link_to_router-1's_g0/1
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    switchport mode trunk
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 12
    switchport trunk allowed vlan add 13
    switchport trunk native vlan 1
    !
    end
    !
    show vlan brief
    !
    show interface trunk
    !
    show interface status
