Hi there! I’m Baltej Giri, and welcome to my corner of the internet. I am a Computer Networking Professional with six plus years of experience in Information Technology. I am passionate about creating network designs, write technical articles, and master networking protocols. I am a lifelong learner and like to stay connected with like minded people.

After six years of industry experience, I decided to start this blog to share my journey with you. Whether you're looking for guides with labs on Network protocols, or just want to reference on a particular network protocols in networking, you’ll find it here.

This blog is for anyone, whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your knowledge about Network Engineering. I’m committed to providing step-by-step practical guides on network protocol. My goal is to help you use this blogpost as a guide while you’re mastering the networking topics.

When I’m not blogging, I love to go on hikes, biking and travel. Feel free to leave a comment or share your thoughts with me—I’d love to connect!

## Skills

- Computer Networking
- Cloud Networking
- Web Development
- Problem-solving
- Technical Documentation

## Roadmap

I am planned to learn Github, Technical Writing, Network Administration tools: Switching, Routing, and Programming language. The ultimate long term goal is to master each of these topics.


### Short-term goals
Being proficient in following skills and tools.
- Github
- Technical Documentation
- Network Administrator
- Network Design

### Mid-term goals

The plan is to have a good understanding of **Python**. Python is a versatile programming language. The network automation is done using Python, it helps to automate repetitive tasks like: Deploying multiple switches, updating policies and much more.

### Long-term goals
The short and mid-term goals are the objectives of long-term goals. The long-term goals are projected to be completed in 2-3 year of time frame. An additional aspect of working in Networking field is to adept with new technologies. ChatGPT is an perfect example of it. There will be some times when i will have to learn some additional skills based of the requirements of my professional career. The ultimate goal is to stay focused and continue learn.

- Mastering network protocols
- Network design
- Python as programming language

## Certifications
IT certifications are great way to prove the skills that an individual has in the field. However, getting an IT certification itself does not help. An IT certification can help to get a job interview or fullfil a requirement on on a job description but what matters on the actual job is experience and deep understanding of protocols.

IT certs can be used to learn the skills, they have a good curriculum to follow but while pursuing a certification, many focus on just getting a certification by all means and often it becomes a chasing game.

Instead solely focusing on getting a certification, in my opinion it is better to use the certification curriculum and master the each concepts. Understand the fundamentals of protocols and technologies. It is important to take time and have a understanding of skills tested in the cert which will pay-off twice, first to excel at job and second to obtain a official cert.
